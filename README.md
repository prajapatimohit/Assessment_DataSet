# Incubyte Data Craftsperson - SQL Analysis

## Problem Statement
Develop optimized SQL queries for analyzing the given dataset, ensuring efficiency, correctness, and scalability.

## Solution Approach
- **Schema Understanding**: Analyzed table structures and relationships.
- **Query Optimization**: Used indexing, joins, and subqueries for efficiency.
- **Edge Cases**: Handled NULL values, duplicates, and performance bottlenecks.
- **Scalability**: Ensured queries perform well on large datasets.

## Queries & Analysis

### 1. Basic Data Retrieval
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10;
```
**Purpose**: Fetch initial records to understand the dataset.

### 2. Employee Count by Department
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY employee_count DESC;
```
**Purpose**: Identify department-wise employee distribution.

### 3. Top 5 Highest Paid Employees
```sql
SELECT name, salary, department
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
**Purpose**: Retrieve highest earners for compensation analysis.

### 4. Average Salary by Department
```sql
SELECT department, ROUND(AVG(salary), 2) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
**Purpose**: Determine average salary trends across departments.

### 5. Employees Hired in the Last Year
```sql
SELECT name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR);
```
**Purpose**: Track recent hires for workforce planning.

### 6. Department with Highest Total Salary Expense
```sql
SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY total_salary DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
**Purpose**: Identify the department with the highest payroll expenditure.

### 7. Employee Retention Analysis
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employees_retained
FROM employees
WHERE resignation_date IS NULL
GROUP BY department;
```
**Purpose**: Measure employee retention across departments.

## Performance Considerations
- **Indexes**: Added indexes on `department`, `salary`, and `hire_date` for faster lookups.
- **Query Execution Plans**: Analyzed EXPLAIN plans to optimize queries.
- **Partitioning**: Considered for large datasets to enhance performance.
## Key Queries and Insights:
- **Overall Counts**:
Total Transactions: 500,001
Total Sales Revenue: â‚¹10,202,743,873.04

-**Sales by Store Type**:

Average discount across products: ~25%.

-**Top Cities by Quantity Sold**:
Bangalore, Jaipur, Delhi, Kolkata, and Chennai are the top cities, each with very similar sales and quantity numbers (~1B in sales).

-**Average Discount by City**:
Average discounts remain consistent across top cities (~24.9% to 25.1%).

-**Promotional Sales by City**:
Around 49-50% of sales in each city are promotional, reflecting a strong promotional strategy.

-**Product-wise Sales and Shipping Info**:
Laptops have the highest sales (~6.23B) with moderate shipping costs (~350) and a delivery time of 4 days.
Sofas generate significant revenue but have higher shipping costs and longer delivery times (10 days).

The South region leads in sales and returned orders, with 72,796 returns. Other regions show consistent return trends, with data quality concerns for NULL regions.

-**Returned Orders by Product**:
Laptops, Sofas, and T-Shirts show the highest sales and returns.
High returns for laptops and sofas might be due to issues like defects, wrong specifications, or delivery damages.
T-shirts' high returns are likely due to size and fit issues.
## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into workforce distribution, salary trends, hiring patterns, and retention metrics, optimizing HR and business decision-making.
